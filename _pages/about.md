<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an undergraduate student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am currently a research assistant student in XLANG Lab (the University of Hong Kong), advised by Prof. Tao Yu. Previously, I was fortunate to work with Prof. Lu Chen and Prof. Kai Yu in Lab X-LANCE (SJTU).

My current research interests mainly focus on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotic learning, including developing model frameworks and designing data scaling strategies to grounding language in physical actions. Also, My research interests lie in the fields of NLP, with a particular focus on long-context models and interpretability.
